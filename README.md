- 👋 Hi, I’m @oyendrila-dobe, aka Oreo (yes, like the cookie!)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about different aspects of [Formal Verification](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/embedded/research/vis/doc/VisUser/vis_user/node4.html)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to modularize and optimize my existing python code for [HyperProb](https://github.com/TART-MSU/HyperProb). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any learning opportunity involving formal methods to argue about security, privacy, and correctness guarantees over systems.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at oyendrila.dobe@gmail.com or check my [personal website](https://oyendrila-dobe.github.io/) for my current work and interests.
